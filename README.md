To do list tracker.  What you've done and what you've still got to do.  See both or either, but it would be kind of silly to see neither.

**What the To-Do List does**

    Dynamically Render the content with React using components
    Use Local Storage to store all to-do list data in the browser
    Display all to-do list items
    Three "views" for the user: All, Completed, & To-Do (not completed)
    Display Prompting text to add item
    Cross out or check off one item as "completed"
    See number of remaining items
    Remove one item (soft delete / archive)
    Check off or cross out all items in one click as a "completed all" function
    Remove all completed items (soft delete / archive)
    Ability to press a button and all checked off items become active again

**Stretch Goals**

    Import Bootstrap using create-react-app - you will also need to install jquery and popper.js
    Create a flow diagram for the front end architecture to be used in an MVP
    Push to GitHub Pages via create-react-app
    Use MySQL
    Edit To-Do's in place
    Write React Tests with create-react-app

**Built With:**
1. HTML
2. Css
3. Bootstrap
4. JS
5. React

**How to Run**
Clone the repository to a local directory. Assuming that you have npm installed go into that directory you just created and run:
npm install
npm start

*********************************
**React added information below**
*********************************
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
